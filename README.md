# Simplication

Simple logic implication visualizer as a communication aide.

## Overview

This is the start of an experiment in logic visualization. The premise is that
a simple logical diagram is more effective than natural language when communicating
proposition logic that entails implication, conjunction, and disjunction. This is born
out of **numerous** collaborative meetings and workgroups in which the group
found itself in an unending confusion loop due to an inability to remember and grasp
seemingly simple logical statements ex. four propositions, two implications with a
conjunction (AND) and a disjunction (OR).
